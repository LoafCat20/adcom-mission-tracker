# AdVenture Communist Mission Tracker

This is a simple tool to assist players of the mobile game AdVenture Communist and related game AdVenture Ages.  The tool allows you to track which missions you have completed, and shows you what missions are coming.

## How to use

Primary Repository: <https://darrenrs.github.io/adcom-mission-tracker/> as of 1 March 2022.

Click on missions in the "Current" area to mark them as Completed.  Click missions in the "Completed" area to undo that, kicking the newest mission back out.

Each mission has a button of its reward capsule next to it.  Clicking this brings up a pop-up with details on the mission, as well as a calculator.  Click "Details" on the calculator for more info.

Switch between Motherland (main) and Event by clicking on the title's dropdown.  Change settings from the "Settings" dropdown.  Other tools can be accessed by clicking the resource, researcher and comrade icons at the top-right.
